# Welcome to my React Markdown Editor!
\n
## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:
\n
Heres some code, \`<div ></div>\`, between 2 backticks.
\n
\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:
\n
function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
    if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
      return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`
\n
You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.
\n
There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and
> Block Quotes!
\n
And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:
\n
Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ |: -------------: | -------------:
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
      - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.
\n
\n
1. And there are numbererd lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. But the list goes on...
- Even if you use dashes or asterisks.
* And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
\n
- [ ] And there are \`unchecked\` lists too.
- [x] And there are \`checked\` lists too.
